Great! Since your copy scaffold system is working, the next logical step is to **complete the contents of the `templates/prefentity/` folder** — the actual files that make `prefentity` powerful.

Here's a **✅ TODO Checklist** with each recommended file, what it should do, and why it matters:

---

### ✅ `templates/prefentity/` Scaffold Contents

| File                      | Purpose                                     | Why It's Needed                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `__init__.py`             | Initialize the package                      | Required to make `prefentity` importable                      |
| `registry.py`             | Track added apps/sites, metadata            | Central manifest of what is installed (like `INSTALLED_APPS`) |
| `state.py`                | Persistent state store (JSON/YAML)          | Holds info like active app/site, env mode                     |
| `logs.py`                 | CLI and system logs                         | Useful for debugging, audit trails                            |
| `backup.py`               | Backup and restore logic                    | Ensures recoverability of apps/sites/data                     |
| `repair.py`               | Check/repair broken or incomplete installs  | Prevents silent errors in bootstrapped apps                   |
| `reinstall.py`            | Wipe and re-init apps/sites                 | Lets you reconfigure or reset modules                         |
| `migrations.py`           | App/site migration interface                | Core for handling DB schema changes and rollback              |
| `manifest.json` or `.yml` | Registry index file for all tracked modules | Stores app/site details with versions/types                   |
| `defaults.py`             | Default config values for scaffolds         | Used when no config is provided during install                |

### 🛠️ Additional Optional Files (Advanced Features)

| File              | Why                                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `installer.py`    | Smart install engine that can auto-run scaffolds, hook tasks |
| `config.py`       | Schema or validation logic for settings                      |
| `diagnostics.py`  | Environment checker for debugging prefiq environments        |
| `scripts/` folder | Holds shell/python scripts for migrations, setup, or export  |

---

### 📁 Suggested Structure:

```
templates/
└── prefentity/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── registry.py
    ├── state.py
    ├── logs.py
    ├── backup.py
    ├── repair.py
    ├── reinstall.py
    ├── migrations.py
    ├── defaults.py
    └── manifest.json       # Or .yml
```

---

### ✅ Suggested Next Steps:

1. Do you want me to **generate these files now** inside your `templates/prefentity/` scaffold (with meaningful starter code)?
2. Or do you want to generate them one by one while working on CLI commands like `prefiq new-app`, `prefiq repair`, etc.?

Let me know your preference, and I’ll proceed accordingly.
